\section{Metrics for Success}

In order to reflect on our final result, we have defined the following success metrics:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Development of a recursive formulation for efficiently solving expected mutual information over several time steps.
  \item Expected mutual information is similar to ground truth mutual information (evaluated in simulation).
  \item Implementation on a quadrotor system demonstrates that the quadrotor navigates towards unexplored areas.
  \item Implementation is real-time for a 2-step horizon, at minimum.
\end{enumerate}
