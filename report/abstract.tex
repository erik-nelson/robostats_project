This work presents a novel framework that enables online exploration of an unknown environment. We use the Cauchy-Schwarz Quadratic Mutual Information (CSQMI) metric to guide a sparse planning graph generated via the Closed-loop RRT (CL-RRT) algorithm. We discuss the
formulation and implementation of the CSQMI metric, the CL-RRT planner, and an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) that were developed to enable state estimation and trajectory tracking.
Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our approach
using a high-fidelity simulation of a mobile ground
robot exploring an unknown space using a laser scanner range sensor.
